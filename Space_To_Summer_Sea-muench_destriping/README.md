**If you intend on using the Docker SeaDAS, cd into vibrantseas-dev and make sure all git submodules are downloaded correctly (if the folder is empty, it's not.**

Open that folder in VSCode/Cursor/Windsurf with the Dev Containers extension installed and it will prompt you to open the folder in the remote container. Open it and press "show logs" to watch the build process. This will likely take several minutes so let it build. once complete, you can run `python3 src/server.py` to start the webserver for processing uploads.
